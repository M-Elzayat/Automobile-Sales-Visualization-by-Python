## 📖 Project Description

The notebook demonstrates how to import, process, and visually analyze automobile sales data over time. The project focuses on identifying patterns and insights using various types of plots such as line charts, boxplots, and interactive maps.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is provided by IBM and includes historical automobile sales data from different years, broken down by factors such as:
- Year
- Month
- Vehicle Type
- Sales figures
- Unemployment rate
- Advertising expenditure
- Recession indicators

**Source:**  
[Automobile Sales Dataset (CSV)](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/Data%20Files/historical_automobile_sales.csv)

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Load and explore real-world datasets using `pandas`.
- Create advanced data visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Build interactive geographical maps using `folium`.
- Analyze trends over time, during recession periods, and across vehicle types.
- Customize visual output for professional reporting.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- `Python 3.8+`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `folium`
- `numpy`
- `requests`
- `io`

---

## 📊 Visualizations Created

### 1. Line Charts
- Yearly trends in automobile sales.
- Comparison of sales in recession vs. non-recession years.

### 2. Bar Charts
- Sales per vehicle type.
- Seasonality in automobile purchases.

### 3. Boxplots & Histograms
- Distribution of sales across different months and years.
- Outlier detection.

### 4. Heatmaps
- Correlation analysis between features like unemployment rate, advertising expenses, and sales.

### 5. Interactive Folium Maps
- Geo-location-based visualizations (e.g., plotting sales per region or state).

Each plot is saved or designed to be exported for final peer evaluation.
